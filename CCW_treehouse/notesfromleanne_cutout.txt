Leanne to update a large technical tutorial (see notebooks/tutorial-notebooks-dev/22*ipynb) about the ObsCore table (needed to query SODA service) and the SODA service. You will have to git pull that branch to get the update. Then, I am to write a separate tutorial that builds on those content (primarily the SODA service) to make a science case/demonstration about the cutout service. time domain imaging movies seems like the right thing to do here. Look at section 3.3 and later in that tutorial to see what to do.

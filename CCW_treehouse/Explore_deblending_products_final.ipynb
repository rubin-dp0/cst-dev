    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an introduction to the data products that are created by the LSST pipeline deblender. In order to build its source catalog and measure photometry of objects in images, the LSST pipeline uses a multi-wavelength deblending algorithm (Scarlet, Melchior et al. 2018) to identify independent detected components within source blends, and separate the flux from independent objects. A \"parent\" source is identified as a region of connected pixels above Signal to Noise (S/N) of XX in the deepCoadd. These regions are called footprints. Each footprint may have one or more peaks, and it is these peaks that the deblender will use to infer the number and positions of objects blended in each footprint. The de-blended sub-peaks are referred to as \"children\" of the parent in the properties saved by the deblender in the objectTable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scarlet separates the flux among components by modeling the flux and shape of each source making up the blend.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, in this tutorial we will identify a heavily blended source with many components, and explore how to use the information in the objectTable produced by the deblender to identify the indepedent sources within the blend. The keywords for sources identified by the deblender should be used to identify unique sources in the objectTable. We will also show an example of how to access metadata that is attached to each deblended source in the objectTable (e.g. the deblended footprints and pixel-weight maps).\n",
    "\n",

    "The pipeline records a number of keywords that can be used to identify and characterize blended sources (parents) that have been deblended into child sources, both of which are ultimately stored in the object and source tables along with isolated single objects that do not require deblending. These keywords help the user identify a unique sample and avoid double counting of objects in queries. In this tutorial we will focus on the objectTable based on the deepCoadd images. Some example boolean flags set by the deblender that are found in the objectTable:\n",
    "\n",
    "**detect_isPrimary**: \tTrue if source has no children, is in inner region of a coadd patch and is in the inner region of a coadd tract, (and is therefore a unique object in the catalog). Note that an object where **detect_isPrimary=True** can still be a deblended child, but itself was not a parent that was separated by the deblender. **To avoid double-counting sources in any selection or query (from including both the parent blend and the nearest child source, or due to including the overlapping area from two or more visits) it is important to set this flag to True.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**detect_fromBlend**: \tThis source is deblended from a parent with more than one child.\n",
    "\n",
    "**detect_isIsolated**: \tThis source was not contained in a blend (source has a single peak, **deblend_nPeaks=True** or its parent only had a single peak **deblend_parentNPeaks=True**). \n",
    "\n",
    "**detect_isDeblendedSource**: \tTrue if source has no children, is in the inner regions of its coadd patch and tract (will be unique) and is either an unblended isolated source or a deblended child from a parent. This is similar to the **detect_isDeblendedModelSource** flag, which is True if source has no children and is a deblended child (but this flag is false for unblended isolated sources).\n",
    " \n",
    "**deblend_skipped**: \tDeblender skipped this source\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some keywords that are set by the deblender that can be used to characterize the blend/deblended sources contained in the objectTable include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**parentObjectId**: \tUnique ID of parent source. \n",
    "\n",
    "**deblend_nPeaks**: \tNumber of peaks contained in the parent blend's footprint (=1 for isolated sources)\n",
    "\n",
    "**deblend_nChild**: \tNumber of peaks deblended from the parent (differs from deblend_nPeaks in that nChild excludes both isolated sources, and child peaks that were culled during deblending)\n",
    "\n",
    "**footprintArea**:  \tNumber of pixels in the sources detection \"footprint\". The footprint is a boolean mask of pixels in the input image that were detected as part of the parent blend. This corresponds to the footprint for the \"reference band\".\n",

However, when searching either through TAP queries or using the butler, one must first identify the region of the sky to search and search in a specific region defined by RA/Dec within a certain search radius or patch/tract. This is because the databases are indexed by RA/Dec and searching by blending keywords (i.e. to identify the most blended sources or by parent object ID) are extremely inefficient. The reason that Qserv is spatially sharded, so querying by RA/Dec is always going to be more efficient than querying by butler dimensions such as patch, tract, etc. RA/Dec is the way to go to optimize TAP queries. (For more information, see tutorial notebook 02 on TAP queries, and notebook 04a on introduction to the Butler).\n",

Perhaps counterintuitively, the parent is identified by **detect_isPrimary = False**, which is a keyword that should be used for identifying unique detections in the objectTable (i.e. **detect_isPrimary = True** are the deblended objects that are also detected in the center of their tracts, i.e. do not also appear in another overlapping image). When selecting samples it is important to ensure **detect_isPrimary = True** to prevent double counting of objects. "
